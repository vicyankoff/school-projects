This is a project for my CS430 Databases class where we had to design and implement a database system. 
In a team of three, we built a small inventory system to keep track of materials, money expenditures and other information the Paint Crew at Truman State University wanted. This system will be especially useful in planning and scheduling for the future but also in keeping control of costs and expendtiures on current projects. It could be used to crete

There are several useful queries that the manager can use to plan for the future and make decisions such as hiring new people, looking at the average costs per building, supplier information and others. 

The tables are normalized to 3rd normal form. 
The diagrams and schemas were done using the diagram creation tool, Dia and the implementation was in MySql.

We also included a GUI interface where the manager could see the different reports, but the code is hosted on the school's servers and unfortunatelly can be accessed only from Truman's IP address. 

The most fun part was creating the EERD diagram and figuring out the relationships between the different entities.
